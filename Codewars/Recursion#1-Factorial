#This is a kata series that you can only solve using recursion.
##1 - Factorial

#In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example,

#5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.

### The value of 0! is 1.

#Your task

### You have to create the function factorial that receives n and returns n!. You have to use recursion.



WITH RECURSIVE factorial(n, fact)             -- Declare Recurisve Query with n and fact as outputs
AS (
